## Editing Projectiles

### Properties

![Properties](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Documentation/assets/72468758/923c25ad-0f19-4630-b503-4ad6072ffd89)

- *Name*: Allows you to give your projectile a name.
- *Folder*: Clicking on the + next to this field will allow you to create a folder in the projectile list for organization
- *Speed (ms)*: Allows you to set the speed in milliseconds which is the time it takes the projectile to travel the range specified. 1000 (ms) = 1 second.
- *Spawn Delay (ms)*: Allows you to set the time between each 'wave' which is defined by quantity.
- *Quantity*: Allows you to set a quantity of how many projectile shot waves are being used.
- *Range*: Allows you to set a range in tiles for how far the projectile will travel.
- *Knockback*: Allows you to set a knockback by tile. When a projectile hits an opponent, it can knock them backward.
- *Collision Spell*: Allows you to set a spell that will cast after the projectile hits an opponent.

### Projectile Spawns

> This allows you to set a projectiles path. Clicking on the red arrows will make them green in which the projectile will be shot in.
> This current screen shot orientation will rotate based on where the player is facing. You configure the projectile assuming the player is facing north/up.
> When selecting more projectile spawns, it allows the player to shoot in multiple directions.

### Animations

![Animation](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Documentation/assets/72468758/fdbdd9e9-ec88-4da2-99cb-3a701e25a120)![Spawn](https://github.com/Richy1111/Intersect-Documentation/assets/72468758/8da339f7-8e88-41f6-bbd9-4743acdf4ba7)


- *Animation*: Allows you to select an animation for the projectile.
- *Spawn Range*: When you change the quantity of projectiles, you can have different projectiles spawn on different sets. For example, you can have a projectile with Quantity: 3 that fires the same projectile 3 times. However, if you add another Animation to the animation list, you can set the spawn range of each animation, indicating on which set those projectiles will fire. For example, have a projectile with Quantity: 5, with the animation "Arcane Missile" set to spawn range 1-3, and the animation "Fire Missile" set to 4-5. So the first 3 waves will be Arcane Missiles, and the 4th and 5th will be Fire Missiles. (Shout to Mcadams for explanation.)
- *Auto Rotate Animation*: Ticking this box will automatically rotate the animation.
